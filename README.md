# Rocket-Launch-2.0
This is a project I created with my friend, Nisa Phelps, for our Object Oriented Programming class in C++, back in 2020. Using your super sharp physics skills and the information given about a rocket, estimate where your projectile will land when launched! If you get it right you win a virtual star!
