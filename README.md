# Rocket-Launch-2.0
This is a project I created with my friend, Nisa Phelps, for our Object Oriented Programming class in C++, back in 2020. Using your super sharp physics skills and the angle of elevation or velocity given about a rocket, estimate where your projectile will land when launched. If you get it right, you win a virtual star!

1.	Make sure to add the proper compiler by typing the following in the command line:

- module purge
- module add compilers/gcc/7.3.0
  
2.	Within the directory containing the files, compile by typing in the command line prompt: 
- g++ *.cpp 
to compile all of the cpp files. 

3.	Run the program by typing into the command line prompt: 
- ./a.out

4.	Follow directions on the program for the duration of the instructions.

5.	Enjoy your launches, you rocket scientist!
